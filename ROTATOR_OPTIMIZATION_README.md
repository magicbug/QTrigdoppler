# Enhanced Rotator Control with 450Â° Optimization

## Overview

The enhanced rotator control system for QTrigDoppler adds intelligent look-ahead capabilities and 450-degree azimuth optimization to improve satellite tracking performance. This system automatically predicts satellite passes and optimizes rotator movement to minimize mechanical wear and provide smoother tracking.

## Key Features

### ðŸ”„ 450-Degree Azimuth Support
- Full support for rotators with 450Â° azimuth range
- Intelligent path planning that considers the extended range
- Automatic selection of optimal routing (direct vs. wraparound)

### ðŸ”® Look-Ahead Prediction
- Predicts satellite passes up to 20 minutes in advance
- Calculates optimal rotator positioning before tracking starts
- Pre-positions rotator for maximum efficiency

### ðŸŽ¯ Route Optimization
- Tests multiple routing strategies for each pass
- Selects the path that minimizes total rotation
- Considers current rotator position in optimization

### ðŸ¤– Automatic Operation
- No user intervention required
- Integrates seamlessly with existing tracking workflow
- Real-time status updates in the UI

## How It Works

### 1. Pass Prediction
When tracking starts, the system:
- **Only optimizes when satellite is visible or approaching horizon** (â‰¥-3Â° elevation)
- Calculates satellite position every 10 seconds for the next 20 minutes (configurable)
- Filters for the visible portion of the pass (above minimum elevation)
- Creates a timeline of azimuth/elevation coordinates
- **Automatically re-predicts** if no optimization exists and satellite is approaching horizon (-3Â° to 0Â°)
- **Triggers prediction at -3Â° elevation** when satellite approaches minimum elevation threshold
- **Clears optimization data** when satellite goes below -10Â° elevation

### 2. Route Optimization
The optimizer tests different strategies:
- **Forward (natural)**: Start at the first azimuth position (0-360Â°)
- **Reverse (450Â°)**: Begin at first_azimuth + 360Â° (if within 450Â° range)
- Considers current rotator position for pre-positioning calculations
- Generates optimized route segments with azimuths that may exceed 360Â°

### 3. Strategy Selection
The system selects the strategy that minimizes:
- Total rotation distance during the pass
- Pre-positioning distance from current position
- Combined movement for the entire tracking session

### 4. Pre-positioning
If beneficial (>10 degrees difference from current position), the rotator moves to the optimal starting position.

### 5. Real-time Tracking
During tracking, the system:
- Uses optimized route segments when available
- Falls back to raw satellite azimuth when no optimization data exists
- Applies 450Â° logic only to unoptimized azimuths (0-360Â° range)
- **Maintains 1Â° tracking accuracy** for both azimuth and elevation
- **Optimizes route timing** by predicting at -3Â° elevation for maximum accuracy
- **Pre-positioning window**: Only uses optimized start azimuth when satellite is between -3Â° and minimum elevation
- **Below horizon**: Uses raw satellite azimuth when satellite is below -3Â° elevation
- **Efficient optimization**: Only generates route segments when satellite is â‰¥-3Â° elevation
- **Memory management**: Clears optimization data when satellite goes below -10Â° elevation

## Example Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Traditional vs. Optimized
**Satellite pass**: 30Â° â†’ 200Â° (typical west-to-east pass)
**Current position**: 350Â°

**Traditional approach**:
- 350Â° â†’ 30Â° = 40Â° rotation
- Track normally through pass
- Total: ~210Â° rotation

**Optimized approach**:
- Pre-position to 390Â° (30Â° + 360Â°)
- Track smoothly: 390Â° â†’ 560Â° (200Â° + 360Â°)
- Total: ~170Â° rotation
- **Savings**: 40Â° less rotation
- **Key**: Rotator receives optimized azimuths >360Â° directly

### Scenario 2: North-South Pass
**Satellite pass**: 350Â° â†’ 10Â° (crossing north)
**Current position**: 180Â°

**Traditional approach**:
- Multiple direction changes
- Inefficient wraparound movements

**Optimized approach**:
- Single smooth arc using 450Â° range
- Minimal direction changes
- Reduced mechanical stress

## Position Polling Optimization

### Intelligent Polling Strategy

The system uses **adaptive position polling** to minimize serial communication while maintaining responsive tracking:

#### Polling Intervals

  - **When tracking**: Polls every 2 seconds maximum
  - **When not tracking**: Polls every 10 seconds minimum
- **Rotator Thread**: Adaptive based on satellite visibility and movement
  - **Satellite visible (â‰¥5Â°)**: Polls every 1 second
  - **Satellite approaching horizon (-10Â° to 5Â°)**: Polls every 3 seconds
  - **Satellite well below horizon (<-10Â°)**: Polls every 10 seconds
  - **Rotator moving**: Polls every 0.5 seconds
  - **Rotator stationary**: Polls every 2 seconds

#### Position Caching
- **Cache timeout**: 500ms to reduce serial calls
- **Cache invalidation**: After position commands or cache timeout
- **Fallback queries**: Individual AZ/EL queries if combined query fails

#### Configuration
```ini
[rotator]
position_poll_interval = 5.0  # Base polling interval in seconds
```

### Performance Benefits
- **Reduced serial traffic**: Up to 80% fewer position queries when not tracking
- **Responsive tracking**: Fast polling when satellite is visible
- **Battery friendly**: Slower polling when rotator is stationary
- **Configurable**: Adjust polling frequency based on hardware capabilities
- **Reduced log noise**: Intelligent logging that only reports significant changes

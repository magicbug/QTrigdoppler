# Enhanced Rotator Control with 450Â° Optimization

## Overview

The enhanced rotator control system for QTrigDoppler adds intelligent look-ahead capabilities and 450-degree azimuth optimization to improve satellite tracking performance. This system automatically predicts satellite passes and optimizes rotator movement to minimize mechanical wear and provide smoother tracking.

## Key Features

### ðŸ”„ 450-Degree Azimuth Support
- Full support for rotators with 450Â° azimuth range
- Intelligent path planning that considers the extended range
- Automatic selection of optimal routing (direct vs. wraparound)

### ðŸ”® Look-Ahead Prediction
- Predicts satellite passes up to 20 minutes in advance
- Calculates optimal rotator positioning before tracking starts
- Pre-positions rotator for maximum efficiency

### ðŸŽ¯ Route Optimization
- Tests multiple routing strategies for each pass
- Selects the path that minimizes total rotation
- Considers current rotator position in optimization

### ðŸ¤– Automatic Operation
- No user intervention required
- Integrates seamlessly with existing tracking workflow
- Real-time status updates in the UI

## How It Works

### 1. Pass Prediction
When tracking starts, the system:
- Calculates satellite position every 10 seconds for the next 20 minutes
- Filters for the visible portion of the pass (above minimum elevation)
- Creates a timeline of azimuth/elevation coordinates

### 2. Route Optimization
The optimizer tests different strategies:
- **Direct**: Start at the first azimuth position (0-360Â°)
- **Start +360**: Begin at first_azimuth + 360Â° (if within 450Â° range)
- **Start -360**: Begin at first_azimuth - 360Â° (if within range)

### 3. Strategy Selection
The system selects the strategy that minimizes:
- Total rotation distance during the pass
- Pre-positioning distance from current position
- Combined movement for the entire tracking session

### 4. Pre-positioning
If beneficial (>30 seconds before AOS), the rotator moves to the optimal starting position.

## Example Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Traditional vs. Optimized
**Satellite pass**: 30Â° â†’ 200Â° (typical west-to-east pass)
**Current position**: 350Â°

**Traditional approach**:
- 350Â° â†’ 30Â° = 40Â° rotation
- Track normally through pass
- Total: ~210Â° rotation

**Optimized approach**:
- Pre-position to 390Â° (30Â° + 360Â°)
- Track smoothly: 390Â° â†’ 560Â° (200Â° + 360Â°)
- Total: ~170Â° rotation
- **Savings**: 40Â° less rotation

### Scenario 2: North-South Pass
**Satellite pass**: 350Â° â†’ 10Â° (crossing north)
**Current position**: 180Â°

**Traditional approach**:
- Multiple direction changes
- Inefficient wraparound movements

**Optimized approach**:
- Single smooth arc using 450Â° range
- Minimal direction changes
- Reduced mechanical stress

## Configuration

### config.ini Settings
```ini
[rotator]
enabled = true
az_max = 450
az_min = 0
el_max = 180
el_min = 0
min_elevation = 5
```

### Required Hardware
- Rotator capable of 450Â° azimuth rotation

## User Interface

### Status Indicators

- **"Error"**: Optimization failed

### Visual Feedback

## üß† What QTRigdoppler does

QTRigdoppler keeps track of satellites and their transponders. It handles mutliple tasks: <br/>
 1) Tracking satellites and calculating the doppler shifts of their used frequencies.<br/>
 2) Update VFOs of a connected ICOM IC-910 (and IC-9700) for fully automatic frequency tracking.<br/>
 3) Depending on the transpoder type: FM/SSB Voice or FM/SSB Data, the software determines the best tracking approch.<br/>
 4) Rotators can be connected to sync their postion with the current satellite.<br/>
 5) A websocket option enable integration into software like [Zenith](https://github.com/magicbug/Zenith).<br/>
 6) There is an optional map you can use to plot the satellites position<br/>

## üåì Choose your style
QTRigdoppler now comes with many themes you can choose from. A brief selection of some themes:

## üì•üíª Installation and Usage

You can run QTRigdoppler as a pre-compiled binary available from the release section. The binary should work on all major Linux dsitributions. Please report any troubles you might encounter.
To make this possible, the binary conatins a full packed python environment which decreases its speed on startup.<br/>

As an alternative, you can install it yourself follwing the installation guides for Ubuntu or Manjaro.

After installation/download you need to adjust the configuration inthe `Settings` Tab to suit your needs. If you have a US configured IC-910 you need to change the rig type from `EU` to `US` otherwise TSL or TONE won't work
You might also need to change the serial port of your CI-V to serial adapter. The easiest solution is to run `sudo dmesg -wH` in a terminal and plugging in your serial adpter to get the serial port name.
Portnames might be `/dev/ttyUSB0`, `/dev/ttyUSB1` .... or `/dev/tty/ACM0` ...
If you like, you can also edit the `config.ini` to access developer or more advanced options.

### Install on Ubuntu 24.10 or higher
 1) It is assumed that you use Ubuntu 24.10 (or newer) or a derivative of it
 2) Open a terminal
 3) Update package sources by:<br/> `sudo apt update`
 5) Install required packages:<br/> `sudo apt install git python3 python3-pyqt5 python3-qt-material python3-ephem python3-numpy`
 6) Add your user to the dialout group to access the serial port by:<br/> `sudo adduser [username, remove brackets] dialout` e.g.: `sudo adduser dl3jop dialout`<br/>
 6.1) Restart you computer for all changes to take effect, than repeat step 2)<br/>
 7) Get the software by:<br/> `git clone https://github.com/dl3jop/QTrigdoppler.git`
 8) Enter software directory by:<br/> `cd QTrigdoppler`
 9) Start using:<br/> `python3 QTrigdoppler.py`
 10) For every startup from now on repeat step 2,7 and 8 or create a starter in the start menu

 TLDR:\
 `sudo apt update`\
 `sudo apt install git python3 python3-pyqt5 python3-qt-material python3-ephem python3-numpy`\
 `sudo adduser [username, remove brackets] dialout`\
 `git clone https://github.com/dl3jop/QTrigdoppler.git`\
 `python3 QTrigdoppler.py`

### Install on Arch or derivatives (e.g.: Manjaro)
The installation process is similar to the one on Ubuntu:<br/>
`sudo pacman -Syu`\
 `sudo pacman -S git python python-pyqt5 python-qt-material python-ephem python-numpy`\
 `sudo usermod -aG uucp [username, remove brackets]`\
 `git clone https://github.com/dl3jop/QTrigdoppler.git`\
 `python3 QTrigdoppler.py`

#### üó∫Ô∏è Requirements for using the map:  
Currently, using the map is not advised due to bad perfomance. If you choose to try it, you'll need these additional python packages:<br/>
`matplotlib`<br/>
`cartopy`<br/>
`pyproj`<br/>

# üìãüîÑ‚è≥ Changelog
DL3JOP modifications:
- Removed hamlib
- Support for IC-910H by direct serial communication, IC-9700 should work as well (not yet tested 
- Implemented transponder selection
- Implemented correct switch between Split mode for V/V & U/U packet and satmode for V/U,U/V
- Implemented doppler correction threshold
- Added SubTone control
- Various smaller changes and additions
- Added binaries

MM9SQL Modifications:
- Changed to PySide
- Implemented Websocket features using Flask and SocketIO
- Added Cloudlog/Wavelog integration: automatic logging of frequency and satellite info via Cloudlog API, configurable in config.ini.
- Added ability to automatically record satellite passes to .wav files.
- Added support to use USB / Serial GPS units to get location position.
- Automatic TLE Updating on Startup or based on hourly time period.
- Satellite Database (doppler.sqf) downloading with merge or replace options from oscarwatch.org.
- Added frequency pause/resume feature: pause frequency updates while keeping rotator tracking for manual frequency control on newer satellites.
- Help files
    
    
# üéØ Roadmap
  - Adding support for IC-9700 (should be easy as it uses nearly the same comands as the IC-910H)
  - Adding support for FT-8xx radios. Same approch: serial driver, although that will add additonal reworks in the doppler tracking loop to account for two radios
  - Building a much nicer GUI
  - Separate GUI and tracking class
  - Refactor tracking loop:
    - no global F0/I0 variables, more abstracted methods to allow eaier implementation of other radios
